# SwiftyMocky

## Overview

**SwiftyMocky** is Lightweight, strongly typed framework for Mockito-like unit testing experience. As Swift doesn't support reflections well enough to allow building mocks in runtime, library depends on Sourcery, that scans your source code and generates Swift code for you.

The idea of **SwiftyMokcy** is to mock Swift protocols. The main features are:

 - easy syntax, utilizing full power of auto-complete, which makes writing test easier and faster
 - mock implementations generation
 - a way to specify what mock will return (given)
 - possibility to specify different return values for different attributes
 - verify, whether a method was called on mock or not
 - check method invocations with specified attributes

### 1. Generating mocks implementations:

One of the boilerplate part of testing and development is writing and updating **mocks** accordingly to newest changes. SwiftyMocky is capable of generating mock implementations (with configurable behavior), based on protocol definition.

During development process it is possible to use SwiftyMocky in a *watcher* mode, which will observe changes in you project files, and regenerate files on the fly.

![Generating mock][example-watcher]

By default, all protocols marked as AutoMockable (inheriting from dummy protocol `AutoMockable` or annotated with `//sourcery: AutoMockable`) are being subject of mock implementation generation. All mocks goes to `Mock.generated.swift`, which can be imported into test target.

### 2. Stubbing return values for mock methods - Given

All mocks has **given** method (accessible both as instance method or global function), with easy to use syntax, allowing to specify what should be return values for given methods (based on specified attributes).

![Generating mock][example-given]

All protocol methods are nicely put into **MethodProxy**, with matching signature. That allows to use auto-complete (just type `.`) to see all mocked protocol methods, and specify return value for them.

All method attributes are wrapped as **Parameter** enum, allowing to choose between `any` and `value`, giving great flexibility to mock behaviour. Please consider following:

```swift
Given(mock, .surname(for name: .value("Johnny"), willReturn: "Bravo"))
Given(mock, .surname(for name: .any(String.self), willReturn: "Kowalsky"))

print(mock.surname(for: "Johny")) // Bravo
print(mock.surname(for: "Mathew")) // Kowalsky
print(mock.surname(for: "Joanna")) // Kowalsky
```

### 3. Check invocations of methods - Verify

All mocks has **verify** method (accessible both as instance method or global function), with easy to use syntax, allowing to verify, whether a method was called on mock, and how many times. It also provides convenient way to specify, whether method attributes matters (and which ones).

![Generating mock][example-verify]

All protocol methods are nicely put into **VerificationProxy**, with matching signature. That allows to use auto-complete (just type `.`) to see all mocked protocol methods, and specify which one we want to verify.

All method attributes are wrapped as **Parameter** enum, allowing to choose between `any` and `value`, giving great flexibility to tests. Please consider following:

```swift
// inject mock to sut. Every time sut saves user data, it should trigger storage storeUser method
sut.usersStorage = mockStorage
sut.saveUser(name: "Johny", surname: "Bravo")
sut.saveUser(name: "Johny", surname: "Cage")
sut.saveUser(name: "Jon", surname: "Snow")

// check if Jon Snow was stored at least one time
Verify(mockStorage, .storeUser(name: .value("Jon"), surname: .value("Snow")))
// storeUser method should be triggered 3 times in total, regardless of attributes values
Verify(mockStorage, 3, .storeUser(name: .any, surname: .any))
// storeUser method should be triggered 2 times with name Johny
Verify(mockStorage, 2, .storeUser(name: .value("Johny"), surname: .any))
```

### 4. Example of usage

For more examples, check out our example project.

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

To trigger mocks generation, run `rake mock` from root directory. For watcher mode, when mocks are generated every time you change your file projects, use `rake mock_watcher` instead.

# Documentation

Full documentation is available [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/MakeAWishFoundation/SwiftyMocky/92717539/docs/index.html), as well as through *docs* directory.

# How to start using SwiftyMocky

Mocks generation is based on `mocky.yml` file.

First, create file in your project root directory with following structure:

```yml
sources:
  - ./ExampleApp
  - ./ExampleAppTests
templates:
  - ./Pods/SwiftyMocky/Sources/Templates
output:
  ./ExampleApp
args:
  testable:
    - ExampleApp
  import:
    - RxSwift
    - RxBlocking
  excludedSwiftLintRules:
    - force_cast
    - function_body_length
    - line_length
    - vertical_whitespace
```

+ **sources**: all directories you want to scan for protocols/files marked to be auto mocked, or inline mocked
+ **templates**: path to SwiftyMocky sourcery templates, in Pods directory
+ **output**: place where `Mock.generated.swift` will be placed
+ **testable**: specify imports for Mock.generated, that should be marked as `@testable` (usually tested app module)
+ **import**: all additional imports, external libraries etc. to be placed in Mock.generated
+ **excludedSwiftLintRules**: if using swift SwiftLint.

## Generate mocks:

1. **manually**: by triggering:

  `Pods/Sourcery/bin/sourcery --config mocky.yml`
1. **in `watch` mode**: changed methods will be reflected in mocks, after generation of mock, by triggering:

  `Pods/Sourcery/bin/sourcery --config mocky.yml --watch`


**Don't forget** to add `Mock.generated.swift` to your test target :)

> **Please Note!**
> Most convenient way is to put generation in some kind of script - like Rakefile below.
> Just create file named Rakefile - generation is triggered by `rake mock`
> ```ruby
> # Rakefile
> task :mock do
>   sh "Pods/Sourcery/bin/sourcery --config mocky.yml"
> end
>
> task :mock_watcher do
>   sh "Pods/Sourcery/bin/sourcery --config mocky.yml --watch"
> end
> ```

## Marking protocols to be mocked

Mark protocols that are meant to be mocked with sourcery annotation as following:

```swift
//sourcery: AutoMockable
protocol ToBeMocked {
  // ...
}
```

Every protocol in source directories, having this annotation, will be added to `Mock.generated.swift`

@objc protocols are also supported, but needs to be explicity marked with ObjcProtocol annotation:

```swift
//sourcery: AutoMockable
//sourcery: ObjcProtocol
@objc protocol NonSwiftProtocol {
  // ...
}
```

## Roadmap

- [x] stubbibg protocols in elegant way
- [x] template for generating mocks
- [x] example project
- [x] stubbing protocols with variables
- [x] method signature generation without name conflicts
- [ ] cover 95% of framework codebase with unit tests
- [ ] add unit tests for template
- [ ] support for tvOS, Linux and MacOS
- [ ] Carthage support

## Installation

SwiftyMocky is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "SwiftyMocky"
```

Then add **mocky.yml** and **Rakefile** (or build script phase) to your project root directory, as described above.

For [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) install instructions, see full [documentation](https://cdn.rawgit.com/MakeAWishFoundation/SwiftyMocky/92717539/docs/index.html).
