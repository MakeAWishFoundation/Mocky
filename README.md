# Mocky

## Overview

**Mocky** is Lightweight, strongly typed framework for Mockito-like unit testing experience. As Swift doesn't support reflections well enough to allow building mocks in runtime, library depends on Sourcery, that scans your source code and generates Swift code for you.

The idea of **SwiftyMokcy** is to mock Swift protocols. The main features are:

 - easy syntax, utilizing full power of auto-complete, which makes writing test easier and faster
 - mock implementations generation
 - a way to specify what mock will return (given)
 - possibility to specify different return values for different attributes
 - verify, whether a method was called on mock or not
 - check method invocations with specified attributes

### 1. Generating mocks implementations:

One of the boilerplate part of testing and development is writing and updating **mocks** accordingly to newest changes. Mocky is capable of generating mock implementations (with configurable behavior), based on protocol definition.

During development process it is possible to use Mocky in a *watcher* mode, which will observe changes in you project files, and regenerate files on the fly.

![Generating mock][example-watcher]

By default, all protocols marked as AutoMockable (inheriting from dummy protocol `AutoMockable` or annotated with `//sourcery: AutoMockable`) are being subject of mock implementation generation. All mocks goes to `Mock.generated.swift`, which can be imported into test target.

### 2. Stubbing return values for mock methods - Given

All mocks has **given** method (accessible both as instance method or global function), with easy to use syntax, allowing to specify what should be return values for given methods (based on specified attributes).

![Generating mock][example-given]

All protocol methods are nicely put into **MethodProxy**, with matching signature. That allows to use auto-complete (just type `.`) to see all mocked protocol methods, and specify return value for them.

All method attributes are wrapped as **Parameter** enum, allowing to choose between `any` and `value`, giving great flexibility to mock behaviour. Please consider following:

```swift
Given(mock, .surname(for name: .value("Johnny"), willReturn: "Bravo"))
Given(mock, .surname(for name: .any(String.self), willReturn: "Kowalsky"))

print(mock.surname(for: "Johny")) // Bravo
print(mock.surname(for: "Mathew")) // Kowalsky
print(mock.surname(for: "Joanna")) // Kowalsky
```

### 3. Check invocations of methods - Verify

All mocks has **verify** method (accessible both as instance method or global function), with easy to use syntax, allowing to verify, whether a method was called on mock, and how many times. It also provides convenient way to specify, whether method attributes matters (and which ones).

![Generating mock][example-verify]

All protocol methods are nicely put into **VerificationProxy**, with matching signature. That allows to use auto-complete (just type `.`) to see all mocked protocol methods, and specify which one we want to verify.

All method attributes are wrapped as **Parameter** enum, allowing to choose between `any` and `value`, giving great flexibility to tests. Please consider following:

```swift
// inject mock to sut. Every time sut saves user data, it should trigger storage storeUser method
sut.usersStorage = mockStorage
sut.saveUser(name: "Johny", surname: "Bravo")
sut.saveUser(name: "Johny", surname: "Cage")
sut.saveUser(name: "Jon", surname: "Snow")

// check if Jon Snow was stored at least one time
Verify(mockStorage, .storeUser(name: .value("Jon"), surname: .value("Snow")))
// storeUser method should be triggered 3 times in total, regardless of attributes values
Verify(mockStorage, 3, .storeUser(name: .any(String.self), surname: .any(String.self)))
// storeUser method should be triggered 2 times with name Johny
Verify(mockStorage, 2, .storeUser(name: .value("Johny"), surname: .any(String.self)))
```

### 4. Example of usage

For more examples, check out our example project.

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

To trigger mocks generation, run `rake mock` from the Example directory. For watcher mode, when mocks are generated every time you change your file projects, use `rake mock_watcher` instead.

# How to start using Mocky

Mocks generation is based on `mocky.yml` file.

First, create file in your project root directory with following structure:

```yml
sources:
  - ./ExampleApp
  - ./ExampleAppTests
templates:
  - ./Pods/Mocky/Mocky/Templates
output:
  ./ExampleApp
args:
  testable:
    - ExampleApp
  import:
    - RxSwift
    - RxBlocking
```

+ **sources**: all directories you want to scan for protocols/files marked to be auto mocked, or inline mocked
+ **templates**: path to Mocky sourcery templates, in Pods directory
+ **output**: place where `Mock.generated.swift` will be placed
+ **testable**: specify imports for Mock.generated, that should be marked as `@testable` (usually tested app module)
+ **import**: all additional imports, external libraries etc. to be placed in Mock.generated

## Generate mocks:

1. **manually**: by triggering:

  `Pods/Sourcery/bin/sourcery --config mocky.yml`
1. **in `watch` mode**: changed methods will be reflected in mocks, after generation of mock, by triggering:

  `Pods/Sourcery/bin/sourcery --config mocky.yml --watch`


**Don't forget** to add `Mock.generated.swift` to your test target :)

> **Please Note!**
> Most convenient way is to put generation in some kind of script - like Rakefile below.
> Just create file named Rakefile - generation is triggered by `rake mock`
> ```ruby
> # Rakefile
> task :mock do
>   sh "Pods/Sourcery/bin/sourcery --config mocky.yml"
> end
>
> task :mock_watcher do
>   sh "Pods/Sourcery/bin/sourcery --config mocky.yml --watch"
> end
> ```

## Marking protocols to be mocked

### 1. AutoMockable annotation

Mark protocols that are meant to be mocked with sourcery annotation as following:

```swift
//sourcery: AutoMockable
protocol ToBeMocked {
  // ...
}
```

Every protocol in source directories, having this annotation, will be added to `Mock.generated.swift`

@objc protocols are also supported, but needs to be explicity marked with ObjcProtocol annotation:

```swift
//sourcery: AutoMockable
//sourcery: ObjcProtocol
@objc protocol NonSwiftProtocol {
  // ...
}
```

### 2. AutoMockable protocol

Create dummy protocol for you project:

```swift
protocol AutoMockable { }
```

Every protocol in source directories, inheriting (directly!) from AutoMockable, will be added to `Mock.generated.swift`, like:

```swift
protocol ToBeMocked: AutoMockable {
  // ...
}
```

### 3. Manual annotation

In some rare cases, when you don't want to use `Mock.generated.swift`, or need to add some additional code to generated mock, you can create base for mock implementation yourself. It will look something like following:

```swift
import Foundation
import Mocky
import XCTest
@testable import TestedApp

// sourcery: mock = "ToBeMocked"
class SomeCustomMock: ToBeMocked, Mock {
  Your custom code can go here

  // sourcery:inline:auto:ToBeMocked.autoMocked

  Generated code goes here...

  // sourcery:end
}
```

## Matcher - handling parameters that are not Equatable

In some cases there is a need to specify return value (by Given) for a method, which parameters are not __*Equatable*__, or check (by Verify), whether a method was called with specific attribute which is not __*Equatable*__.

If you try to perform Given or Verify for explicit parameter, whereas its type is not Equatable, **fatalError** will occur. There are two options to handle attributes types, that are not __*Equatable*__:

**1) Use only wildcard .any parameters, or adopt Equatable**

Sometimes .any is enough, or you can provide Equatable implementation.

**2) Register comparator for that type in Matcher**

Every Mock has `matcher` variable, which is `Matcher.default` singleton instance by default.

Usage of **Matcher**:

```swift
struct User {
  let id: String
  let name: String
}

// ...

override func setUp() {
  // register all comparators for custom, non equatable attributes
  Matcher.default.register(User.self) { lhs,rhs -> Bool in
      return lhs.id == rhs.id
  }
}

func testFetchUserDetails() {
  //...
  let john = User(id: "Johny123", name: "Johny")
  // now we can safely verify explicit parameter
  Verify(mockNetwork, .fetchUserDetails(for: .value(john)))
}
```

## Installation

Mocky is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "Mocky"
```

Then add **mocky.yml** and **Rakefile** (or build script phase) to your project root directory, as described above.

## Current version

Master branch is still in beta, breaking changes are possible.
