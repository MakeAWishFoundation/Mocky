# Known issues

## 1. When triggering generation - error about modules in different swift versions appears

This seems to be a problem with dependency to Sourcery, which, for some case, event if included as dependency in Pods, does not use project swift version setting. Use swift version support branches, or download/build Sourcery binary manually
